# WildAnnies-Traders-Napf-
Traders and Marker files and code for use with arma 3 Exile on the Napf map.

Included files:

classMarkersFromMission.sqm - A revised set of map markers to show new trader positions and safezone sizes
                                (smaller safe zones than default)

initPlayerLocal.sqf - Trader positions, types, animations

initServer.sqf - Trader camp objects, signs, etc

NOTES

Helipads (inlcuding invisible pads) are set at vehicle traders to mark suitable safe spawn positions if the server is set up to use the ExileServer_system_trading_network_purchaseVehicleRequest by krwtt. You can find it at http://www.exilemod.com/topic/6864-release-purchased-vehicles-spawn-at-specific-location/  
Rememeber that if you are using infistar you will need to add trader exclusions (anti-TP) to stop spawns being immediately moved back.

Feel free to change around the camps as you require for your server.
Don't blame me if things go bang - you will need to set things up right to get it working right and I DO recommend using the above mentioned script by krwtt to make sure new bought vehicles dont go boom.
If you are able to give a little credit or kudos if you use the camps then thats awesome. If not, then meh, that's life.

Enjoy.
